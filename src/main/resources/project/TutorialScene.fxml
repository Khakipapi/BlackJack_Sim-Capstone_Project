                        <Label style="-fx-background-color: #000000;" text="Blackjack&#10;Blackjack is a card game involving standard, 52-card decks, luck, chance, and strategy. The goal is to gather cards to get as close as possible to 21 without going over and to have a higher hand than the dealer.&#10;&#10;﻿Betting&#10;First, you must make a bet before the start of each match. It can be anywhere from $1 to all of your money. You place your bet for the next match by dragging the bet slider.&#10;&#10;﻿Deal&#10;Once you choose your bet, click 'Deal'. At this point, your bet value is deducted from your bank balance, and you cannot change your bet until the next match. The dealer will give you two cards, which form your hand, and two cards to themselves. Your cards will be face up, while one of the dealer's cards will initially be face down. To win, you must ensure the combined value of your hand's cards exceeds the dealer's while not exceeding 21.&#10;&#10;Hit&#10;﻿You can add more cards to your hand by selecting 'Hit', but be careful: Whoever gets more than 21 automatically loses. &#10;&#10;Stand&#10;Once you're ready to play your hand, select 'Stand'. The dealer will then reveal their hidden card and continue hitting until their hand exceeds 16.&#10;&#10;Card Values&#10;﻿An Ace card is worth 1 or 11 based on the best possible combination. Face cards (K, Q, or J) are worth 10. Other cards are worth their inscribed value. For example, an Ace and 8 will be worth 19, but if the hand receives a 7, the Ace will become 1, for a total of 1+8+7 = 16. A 10 and Joker are worth 20, while an Ace and Queen are worth 21.&#10;&#10;Winning&#10;You win by having a higher hand than the dealer or if the dealer's hand goes over 21. ﻿A Bust happens when a hand goes over 21 and is an instant loss. A Blackjack occurs when a hand has two cards that sum to 21. In most cases, whoever gets 21 wins. Blackjacks beat any combination of cards except for another Blackjack. A Push happens when the player and dealer tie, in which case, the player receives their bet back. Winning a match will reward you with double your bet. For instance, if you bet $500 and win, you will receive $1,000. A Blackjack has a higher payoff of 3-to-2 (or 2.5 times your bet). If you bet $500 and get a Blackjack, you will receive $1250.&#10;&#10;Double&#10;﻿﻿You can double your bet by selecting 'Double' as long as your hand only has two cards. If you double your bet, you automatically take one card and immediately Stand. You can only Double if you have enough money in the bank to increase your bet.&#10;&#10;Split&#10;If you get two cards of the same value (A and A, 8 and 8, or even Q and 10), you can select 'Split' to split your hand. When you Split, you make two separate hands with your duplicate cards and gain one new card for each hand. Afterward, you play each hand against the dealer's, with separate wins or losses. You can perform up to 3 Splits per match. Like Doubling, you can only Split if you have enough money in the bank.&#10;&#10;Insurance&#10;If the dealer's revealed card is an Ace (meaning they likely have a Blackjack), you can select 'Insurance' to take insurance before performing other actions on a hand of two cards. Once selected, you place an additional bet that is half of the original's. This bet is separate from the actual bet. If the dealer does not have a Blackjack, you lose the insurance, and the game resumes. However, if the dealer has a Blackjack, the match will immediately end, and you will win 2-to-1 (double) of your insurance on your current hand. The dealer will still win the match, but you will receive your money back for the hand you placed insurance on. Use insurance if you think there are many ten cards in the deck.&#10;&#10;﻿Suggestions&#10;Suggestions can help you determine if you should Hit, Stand, Double, or Split during a match. Suggestions consider your hand, the dealer's up card, and how likely you are to bust if you hit.&#10;&#10;Player Stats&#10;When you set up and log into your account, the game saves your progress as you play blackjack matches. Visit the stats screen to see how your luck and strategy compare to other players. If you run out of money, your stats will be reset, but there are unlimited attempts, so you can play again!" textFill="WHITE" wrapText="true">
