The goal is to gather cards to get as close as possible to 21 without going over and to have a higher hand than the dealer.&#10;&#10;﻿Betting&#10;First, you must make a bet before the start of each match. It can be anywhere from $1 to all of your money. You place your bet for the next match by dragging the bet slider.&#10;&#10;﻿Deal&#10;Once you choose your bet, click 'Deal'. At this point, you cannot change your bet until the next match. The dealer will give you two cards, which form your hand, and two cards to themselves. Your cards will be face up, while one of the dealer's cards will initially be face down. To win, you must ensure the combined value of your hand's cards exceeds the dealer's while not exceeding 21.&#10;&#10;Hit&#10;﻿You can add more cards to your hand by selecting 'Hit', but be careful: Whoever gets more than 21 automatically loses. &#10;&#10;Stand&#10;Once you're ready to play your hand, select 'Stand'. The dealer will then reveal their hidden card and continue hitting until their hand exceeds 16.&#10;&#10;Card Values&#10;﻿An Ace card is worth 1 or 11 based on the best possible combination. Face cards (K, Q, or J) are worth 10. Other cards are worth their inscribed value. For example, an Ace and 8 will be worth 19, but if the hand receives a 7, the Ace will become 1, for a total of 1+8+7 = 16. A 10 and Joker are worth 20, while an Ace and Queen are worth 21.&#10;&#10;Winning&#10;You win by having a higher hand than the dealer or if the dealer's hand goes over 21. ﻿A Bust happens when a hand goes over 21 and is an instant loss. A Blackjack occurs when a hand has two cards that sum to 21. In most cases, whoever gets 21 wins. Blackjacks beat any combination of cards except for another Blackjack. A Push happens when the player and dealer tie, in which case, the player receives their bet back. Winning a match will reward you with double your bet. For instance, if you bet $500 and win, you will receive $1,000. A Blackjack has a higher payoff of 3-to-2 (or 2.5 times your bet). If you bet $500 and get a Blackjack, you will receive $1250.&#10;&#10;Double&#10;﻿You can double your bet by selecting 'Double' once the dealer hands out the initial cards and before hitting or standing. If you double your bet, you automatically take one card and immediately Stand. You can only Double if you have enough money in the bank to increase your bet." textFill="WHITE" wrapText="true">
